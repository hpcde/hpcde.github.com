abstract: Material irradiation effect is one of the most important keys to use nuclear
  power. However, the lack of high-throughput irradiation facility and knowledge of
  evolution process, lead to little understanding of the addressed issues. With the
  help of high-performance computing, we could make a further understanding of micro-level-material.
  In this paper, a new data structure is proposed for the massively parallel simulation
  of the evolution of metal materials under irradiation environment. Based on the
  proposed data structure, we developed the new molecular dynamics software named
  Crystal MD. The simulation with Crystal MD achieved over 90% parallel efficiency
  in test cases, and it takes more than 25% less memory on multi-core clusters than
  LAMMPS and IMD, which are two popular molecular dynamics simulation software. Using
  Crystal MD, a two trillion particles simulation has been performed on Tianhe-2 cluster.
